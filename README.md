# Wentworth_Student_Login_Page
Login page using vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

**Note: I am learning how to connect this app with php and deploy another version of it via Heroku. 

### What is this?
This is a typical login page where the user signs in with a user name and password. In this case, I like the design of my college's student login page so I decided to create a clone to learn how it is done.
